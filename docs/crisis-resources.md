# Crisis Resources

Crisis resources are emergency support services — hotlines, crisis chats, and other immediate-help contacts. They are separate from internet resources because they have a different structure focused on contact methods and availability.

## What Makes Crisis Resources Different

Unlike internet resources (which are curated links to external content), crisis resources represent **services people can contact directly**. They emphasize:

- Multiple contact methods (phone, text, chat, email)
- Availability schedules (what hours and days the service operates)
- Quick access to help in urgent situations

## Crisis Resource Fields

|-------|---------|
| **Name** | The name of the crisis resource (may differ from its website name) |
| **Description** | Rich text description of the service (supports bold, italic, links) |
| **URL** | Link to the service's website (optional) |
| **Website** | Reference to a Website document for attribution (optional) |
| **Categories** | Which categories this resource belongs to |
| **Populations** | Which audience segments this resource serves |

## Contact Methods

Each crisis resource can have multiple contact methods. For each one, you specify:

### Contact Type

| Type | What You Provide |
|------|-----------------|
| **Phone** | A telephone number, plus availability schedule |
| **SMS / Text** | A phone number for texting, optional predefined text message body, plus availability schedule |
| **Email** | An email address |
| **Live Chat** | A URL to the live chat service, plus availability schedule |
| **Contact Form** | A URL to a web contact form |
| **TTY** | A TTY number for hearing-impaired callers, plus availability schedule |

### Availability Schedules

For phone, SMS, live chat, and TTY contact methods, you can set availability schedules that tell users when the service is available:

- **Days** — Which days of the week (defaults to all days)
- **Available From / To** — Operating hours
- **Timezone** — Eastern, Central, Mountain, or Pacific

You can add multiple availability entries if the service has different hours on different days.
