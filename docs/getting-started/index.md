# Getting Started

Before contributing to the Why Grief Matters CMS project you'll need to be **invited** to the `grief-matters-cms` project by someone with the `Administrator` role. Currently the only admin is Dan, so if you need an invite contact him at [dan@danlechambre.com](mailto:dan@danlechambre.com?subject=Request%20invite%20to%20WGM%20CMS).

Once you've received an invitation you'll need to set up an account on [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/login/sign-up). Your Sanity account si what you'll log in to the CMS with.

The Sanity Studio CMS is currently deployed to: <https://grief-matters-sanity-studio.netlify.app>
