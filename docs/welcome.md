# Welcome to Why Grief Matters CMS

This is the content management studio for [whygriefmatters.org](https://whygriefmatters.org). Here you can create, edit, and organize grief support resources that help people navigate loss and bereavement.

## How the Studio Is Organized

The Studio sidebar groups content into four sections:

1. **Singletons** — One-of-a-kind documents. Currently this is just the Organization profile, which controls site-wide branding, logos, and legal text.

2. **Documents** — Core content types that structure the site:
   - **Categories** — The hierarchical topic tree that organizes all content
   - **Populations** — Audience segments for filtering resources
   - **Content Blocks** — Reusable page sections made of text, images, and links
   - **Content Groups** — Page-level containers that arrange content blocks
   - **Crisis Resources** — Emergency support services with contact information
   - **Websites** — Source/attribution records for internet resources
   - **People** — Team member profiles
   - **Person Groups** — Named groups of people (e.g., "Board of Directors")
   - **Image Collections** — Groups of images used as fallbacks

3. **Internet Resources** — 18 types of curated external links (articles, books, podcasts, videos, apps, and more). This is the bulk of the site's content.

4. **Documentation** — These help pages (you're reading one now).

## What Your Content Does

Everything you create or edit in this Studio feeds into the whygriefmatters.org website. The site is **statically generated** — your changes appear after the site is rebuilt and deployed. The key things to understand:

- **Categories** define the site's navigation structure. Resources tagged with categories appear on those category pages.
- **Populations** enable filtered views of content for specific audiences.
- **Content Blocks and Content Groups** let you compose custom page layouts.
- **Internet Resources** are the core content — curated links to external grief support materials.
