# Websites

Website documents represent **source websites** — the organizations or sites that publish grief support resources. They serve as attribution records: when you create an internet resource, you can link it to a Website to show where it comes from.

## How Websites Differ from Internet Resources

Websites are not just another resource type — they have a different structure:

| | Website | Other Internet Resources |
|---|---------|------------------------|
| **Name field** | Uses "Name" (the organization/website name) | Uses "Title" (the resource title) |
| **Image** | Has a "Logo" field | Has an "Image" field with alt text |
| **Source** | Cannot reference another website (it IS the source) | Can reference a Website as its source |

## Website Fields

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Website Name** | The name of the website or organization (required) |
| **URL** | The website's homepage URL (required) |
| **Description** | Brief description of the website (max 255 characters recommended) |
| **Description Quoted** | Toggle indicating the description is quoted directly from the website |
| **Available in Spanish** | Whether the website has Spanish-language content |
| **Logo** | The website's logo image |
| **Categories** | Which categories this website belongs to |
| **Populations** | Which audience segments this website serves |

## URL Best Practices

The URL field has a validation warning if the URL appears to point to a specific page rather than a homepage (i.e., if it has a path beyond the domain). Website documents should link to the **homepage** of the site, not to a specific resource page. If you want to link to a specific page, create an internet resource instead.

**Good:** `https://www.example.org/`
