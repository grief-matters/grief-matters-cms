## Quick Start Guide

1. Create a Sanity account and join our Sanity Org
2. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/grief-matters/grief-matters-cms.git`
3. `cd` into the project
4. Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project and add to it the following environment variables:
   ```shell
   SANITY_STUDIO_PROJECT_ID="PROJECT_ID" #replace with the actual ID
   SANITY_STUDIO_DATASET="dev"
   SANITY_STUDIO_API_VERSION="2023-07-16"
   ```
   Our Sanity project has a public API - so these environment variables do not need to be treated as secrets.
5. Create a file named `.dev.vars` in the root of your project and add the following variables:
   ```shell
   WEBSITE_DEPLOY_HOOK="" # not needed in local development
   SANITY_STUDIO_DATASET="dev"
   ``` 
   These variables are required for local development.
6. Run `npm install` at the root of the project to install all dependencies.
7. Run `npm run dev` at the root of the project folder. This will build the studio application and start a local development server (you'll be prompted to authenticate with your Sanity credentials).
8. Once the build is complete, you can head over to http://localhost:3333.
