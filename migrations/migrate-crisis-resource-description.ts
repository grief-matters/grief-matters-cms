/**
 * Run this script from within project folder e.g: `sanity exec --with-user-token migrations/script.ts`
 *
 * This will migrate documents in batches of 100 and continue patching until no more documents are
 * returned from the query.
 *
 * This script can safely be run, even if documents are being concurrently modified by others.
 * If a document gets modified in the time between fetch => submit patch, this script will fail,
 * but can safely be re-run multiple times until it eventually runs out of documents to migrate.
 *
 * A few things to note:
 * - This script will exit if any of the mutations fail due to a revision mismatch (which means the
 *   document was edited between fetch => update)
 * - The query must eventually return an empty set, or else this script will continue indefinitely
 *
 * Fetching documents that matches the precondition for the migration.
 * NOTE: This query should eventually return an empty set of documents to mark the migration
 * as complete
